# optiseek

An open source collection of single-objective optimization algorithms for multi-dimensional functions.

The purpose of this library is to give users access to a variety of optimization algorithms with extreme ease of use and interoperability.
The parameters of each of the algorithms can be tuned by the users and there is a high level of input uniformity between algorithms of similar type.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install optiseek
```

## Usage

`optiseek` provides access to numerous optimization algorithms that require minimal effort from the user. An example using the well-known particle swarm optimization algorithm can be as simple as this:

```python
from optiseek.metaheuristics import particle_swarm_optimizer
from optiseek.testfunctions import booth

# create an instance of the algorithm, set its parameters, and solve
my_algorithm = particle_swarm_optimizer(booth)  # create instance to optimize the booth function
my_algorithm.b_lower = [-10, -10] # define lower bounds
my_algorithm.b_upper = [10, 10] # define upper bounds

# execute the algorithm
my_algorithm.solve()

# show the results!
print(my_algorithm.best_value)
print(my_algorithm.best_position)
print(my_algorithm.completed_iter)
```

This is a fairly basic example implementation without much thought put into parameter selection. Of course, the user is free to tune the parameters of the algorithm any way they would like.
